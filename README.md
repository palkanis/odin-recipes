# odin-recipes
The objective of this project was to create a webpage consisting of three links to three different recipes.
While working on this project, I was able to apply all the knowledge gained from the HTML section of the Foundations course of The Odin Project like Elements, Tags, Boilerplate initializtion, adding links and images, creating lists etc.
After working on this project, I feel quite comfortable with the basics of HTML and looking forward to learn more in the world of web development.
