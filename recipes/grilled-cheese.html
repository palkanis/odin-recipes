    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This jalapeño popper grilled cheese is an awesome spin on a plain grilled cheese sandwich.</p> 
    <p>Feel free to alter it to your liking.</p>
    <p>The ciabatta bread is not typical grilled cheese material but the crunch of the buttery grilled chewy bread goes perfectly with this jalapeño filling.</p> 
    <p>You can also use sourdough bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>

        <li>10 pickled jalapeno pepper slices, or to taste - chopped</li>

        <li>2 ciabatta sandwich rolls</li>

        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>

        <li>8 tortilla chips, crushed</li>

       <li>½ cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, sour cream, and pickled jalapeno in a small bowl. Set aside. Preheat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Slice each roll in half horizontally, then slice the rounded tops off the ciabatta rolls to make a flat top half. 
            <p>Spread 1 teaspoon butter on the doughy cut side of the bottom bun and 1 teaspoon butter on the now flattened top bun.</p> 
            <p>Place 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture, 1/2 of the crushed chips, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese on the non-buttered side of the bottom bun.</p> 
            <p>Place the top half of the bun on the sandwich and place the sandwich on the hot skillet. Repeat with the second sandwich.</p></li>
        <li>Grill until lightly browned and flip over, about 3 to 5 minutes; continue grilling until cheese is melted and the second side is golden brown.</li>
